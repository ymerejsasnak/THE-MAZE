# THE-MAZE
* a simple, semi-polished(?) pygame game
* a really difficult maze, with limited visibility, but with that difficulty
mitigated by items the player picks up along the way


## TO DO:
* clean up everything done so far
* implement proper difficulty levels and adjust item count/frequency
* add sfx for item get/use?
* fix sudden cutoff of secondary music? (export with fade tail!)
* implement win condition stuff 
* (scrap or implement timer/step counter/scoring???)
* add instructions (opens new window?)
* randomly add flavor/atmosphere text every so often in title bar?
(ie 'its cold in here', 'i don't like the way my footsteps echo', etc)
